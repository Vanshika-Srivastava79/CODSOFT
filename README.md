**Project Name: Number Game**
<br>
The Number Game is a simple Java-based program that generates a random number within a specified range of 1 to 100.
The user enters their guess for a limited number of attempts. By comparing the value entered with the generated number, a feedback is provided on whether the guess is correct, too high or too low.
The user can play the game for multiple rounds. The program terminates with the user's score in the game.
